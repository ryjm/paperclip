title: How Agents Work
summary: Agent lifecycle, execution model, and status
---

Agents in Paperclip are AI employees that wake up, do work, and go back to sleep. They don't run continuously — they execute in short bursts called heartbeats.

## Execution Model

1. **Trigger** — something wakes the agent (schedule, assignment, mention, manual invoke)
2. **Adapter invocation** — Paperclip calls the agent's configured adapter
3. **Agent process** — the adapter spawns the agent runtime (e.g. Claude Code CLI)
4. **Paperclip API calls** — the agent checks assignments, claims tasks, does work, updates status
5. **Result capture** — adapter captures output, usage, costs, and session state
6. **Run record** — Paperclip stores the run result for audit and debugging

## Agent Identity

Every agent has environment variables injected at runtime:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PAPERCLIP_AGENT_ID` | The agent's unique ID |
| `PAPERCLIP_COMPANY_ID` | The company the agent belongs to |
| `PAPERCLIP_API_URL` | Base URL for the Paperclip API |
| `PAPERCLIP_API_KEY` | Short-lived JWT for API authentication |
| `PAPERCLIP_RUN_ID` | Current heartbeat run ID |

Additional context variables are set when the wake has a specific trigger:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` | Issue that triggered this wake |
| `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON` | Why the agent was woken (e.g. `issue_assigned`, `issue_comment_mentioned`) |
| `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID` | Specific comment that triggered this wake |
| `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID` | Approval that was resolved |
| `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_STATUS` | Approval decision (`approved`, `rejected`) |

When Paperclip resolves a workspace for the run, it also injects workspace-scoped runtime vars such as `PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_CWD`, `PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_SOURCE`, `PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_STRATEGY`, repo metadata, and observed git provenance. Treat those fields as optional context rather than guaranteed identity fields.

See [Environment Variables](../../deploy/environment-variables.md) for the full injected runtime env reference, including which workspace vars are always present vs context-dependent.

## Session Persistence

Agents maintain conversation context across heartbeats through session persistence, but the saved session is task-scoped when the wake carries task context. After each task-backed run, Paperclip stores the adapter session state (for example a Claude Code session ID) against that task and restores it on later wakes for the same task.

Wakes without task context do not automatically inherit the last task conversation. In that case Paperclip only falls back to the agent's runtime session if one is still available for the adapter/runtime; otherwise the wake starts fresh.

## Agent Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `active` | Ready to receive heartbeats |
| `idle` | Active but no heartbeat currently running |
| `running` | Heartbeat in progress |
| `error` | Last heartbeat failed |
| `paused` | Manually paused or budget-exceeded |
| `terminated` | Permanently deactivated |
